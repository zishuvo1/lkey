Bug ID,Title / Summary,Module,Severity,Priority,URL,Steps to Reproduce,Expected Result,Actual Result,Notes / Impact
DEF-001,CRITICAL SECURITY: No Brute-Force Protection on Login,Login,Critical,P1,Login Page,"1. Go to the login page.
2. Enter a valid email and a random, incorrect password.
3. Repeat step 2 more than 10 times quickly.","After a few invalid attempts (e.g., 5), the account should be temporarily locked, or a CAPTCHA should appear to prevent automated attacks.","The system allows an unlimited number of login attempts without any restriction, delay, or warning.","Impact: This is a major security vulnerability that exposes user accounts to automated brute-force attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access. Needs immediate fixing."
DEF-002,"Server Crashes with ""500 Error"" on Checkout with Invalid Data",Checkout,Critical,P1,Checkout Page,"1. Add an item to the cart and proceed to checkout.
2. In the billing details, enter an invalid email or phone number format (e.g., ""test"" or ""123"").
3. Click ""Place Order"".","The system should display a user-friendly validation error message (e.g., ""Please enter a valid email"") and prevent form submission.","The entire application crashes and displays a generic ""500 Server Error"" page.",Impact: This completely breaks the checkout process for any user who makes a simple typo. It results in a very poor user experience and directly causes lost sales.
DEF-003,Support Ticket System is Completely Inaccessible,Support,High,P1,My Account,"1. Log in to a user account.
2. Navigate to ""My Account"" or find any link intended for creating a support ticket.
3. Click the support link.","The support ticket creation page should open, allowing the user to submit their query.","The page fails to load and shows a browser error: ""pm.bluedot.ltd refused to connect.""","Impact: Customers have no official way to get support for their orders, report issues, or ask questions. This is a critical failure in customer service functionality."
DEF-004,No Confirmation Email Sent After New User Registration,Registration,High,P1,Register Page,"1. Go to the registration page.
2. Fill in all details with a new, valid email address.
3. Complete the registration process.","A new account should be created, and a confirmation/welcome email should be immediately sent to the user's registered email address for verification.","The user account is successfully created and the user can log in, but no confirmation or welcome email is ever sent.",Impact: This is a security risk as unverified emails can be used. It also breaks standard user onboarding and marketing automation flows.
DEF-005,Contact Us Form Submission Fails with an Error,Contact,Medium,P2,Contact Page,"1. Go to the ""Contact Us"" page.
2. Fill out the name, email, and message fields with valid information.
3. Click the ""Submit"" button.","A success message should be displayed on the screen, and the query should be delivered to the support team's inbox.","The form submission fails, and an unhelpful error message is shown: ""Sorry, mail us in info (at) bluedot (dot) ltd"".","Impact: The primary channel for general inquiries and potential business leads is broken. Users are forced to manually copy the email address, creating friction."
DEF-006,Incorrect Validation Message for Invalid Email Format on Login,Login,Medium,P2,Login Page,"1. Go to the login page.
2. Enter an email with an invalid format (e.g., ""test@xyz"" or just ""test"").
3. Enter any password and click ""Login"".","The page should show a client-side validation error like ""Please enter a valid email address"" before submitting the form.","The form is submitted, and a server-side error is returned: ""These credentials do not match our records.""","Impact: This is confusing for the user, as the error message misdiagnoses the problem. The user will think their password is wrong, not that their email format is invalid."
DEF-007,No User-Facing Option to Initiate Refund or Cancellation,Order/Support,Medium,P2,My Account,"1. Place a successful order.
2. Go to the ""My Orders"" section in the user account.
3. View the details of the recent order.","There should be a visible button or link to ""Request Refund"" or ""Cancel Order"" if the order is eligible, as per the site's refund policy.","No such option is available on the order details page. The user has no clear, self-service path to initiate a refund or cancellation.",Impact: This creates a poor post-purchase experience and will likely increase the load on support channels (once they are fixed) with manual requests.
DEF-008,"Missing ""Show/Hide Password"" Toggle Feature",Login & Registration,Low,P2,"Login, Register","1. Go to the login or registration page.
2. Type in the password field.",An icon or toggle button should be visible next to the password field to allow the user to see the characters they are typing.,"The password field is masked by default, but no functionality exists to unmask it temporarily.","Impact: This is a standard UX and accessibility feature. Its absence can lead to user frustration and login failures due to typos, especially with complex passwords."
DEF-009,FAQ / Knowledgebase Section is Missing from the Website,Support/UI,Low,P3,Entire Site,"1. Navigate through the website's header, footer, and support-related sections.
2. Look for a link to an FAQ, Help Center, or Knowledgebase.",A dedicated and easily accessible FAQ or Help Center page should be available to provide answers to common customer questions.,No FAQ page or knowledgebase section could be found anywhere on the website.,"Impact: This is a missing feature, not a functional bug. Its absence means users cannot self-serve, leading to a higher volume of preventable support requests."
